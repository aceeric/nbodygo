This sim creates a slowly moving sun, then starts two streams of objects
moving in opposite directions around the sun. The streams migrate as their
orbits follow the sun.

Assumes that you're at a directory with the server executable at: ./bin/server and the client
is at ./bin/client

First, start an empty sim:
bin/server --sim-name=empty &
